  Analyzed the computational complexities with and without CRN in stochastic optimization and theoretically demonstrated that CRN can significantly reduce the computational burden.

  Enhanced the finite-time performance of the adaptive sampling trust-region method for simulation optimization through four key refinements:
  - Improved the chances of identifying better solutions by integrating direct search techniques.
  - Constructed a quadratic model with a diagonal Hessian within the trust-region framework.
  - Reused previously evaluated solutions and corresponding simulation outputs to reduce computational cost.
  - Applied Common Random Numbers (CRN) to reduce the variance in function and gradient estimates.

  Demonstrated that the refined algorithms converge almost surely to a first-order stationary point.

  Developed simulation optimization solvers and test problems from scratch in Python.

  Designed a stochastic oracle for traffic signal control problems, analyzed its loss landscape characteristics, and evaluated the performance of various solvers.
